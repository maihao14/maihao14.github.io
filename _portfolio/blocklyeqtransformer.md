Blockly Earthquake Transformer (BET) is an open-source, no-code platform for building seismic phase pickers on top of the EQTransformer (EqT) model. It provides an interactive, form-driven workflow so seismologists and developers can configure data, model settings, and training without direct code edits.

Highlights
- Web-app workflow for detection and phase picking using EqT
- Upload data and customize model arguments through interactive forms
- Use pretrained models or retrain with transfer learning and fine-tuning
- Extend phase types beyond P/S (e.g., Pn, Pg, Sn, Sg) when labeled data is available
- Build reusable workflows, visualize training, and generate publishable figures

- Repository, documentation, and installation: [BlocklyEQTransformer on GitHub](https://github.com/maihao14/BlocklyEQTransformer)
