QuakeLabeler helps seismologists and developers (no AI specialization required) create, label, and inspect seismic training datasets quickly and independently. It consolidates the full workflow in one place so teams can focus on model development rather than data plumbing.

Highlights
- Retrieve waveform data directly from data centers
- Customize seismic samples and auto-build datasets
- Preprocess, augment, and label data for ML workflows
- Visualize distributions and dataset quality
- Operate via an interactive CLI with minimal Python knowledge

Get started
- Repository: [QuakeLabeler on GitHub](https://github.com/maihao14/QuakeLabeler)
- Documentation, installation, and scripts: [QuakeLabeler docs](https://maihao14.github.io/QuakeLabeler/)
- Tip: If your data is local, switch to localmode
